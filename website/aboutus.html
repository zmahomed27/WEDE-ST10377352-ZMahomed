    <p>Mammas chicken was established in the early 2000s.Started with Riaz Nakooda and his mother selling chicken door-to-door.It started off like that and eventually scaled up into purchasing more chickens and purchasing a bigger place to work.
        now we are at our best and striving to be the best.The chickens are freshly cut and packaged and sent to homes or Mammas franchises all over South Africa and a couple stores in Lesotho.
        At mammas we do not just pocket the profits but we like to give back to the surrounding communities as we feel this is our home town and we should give back to the less fortunate.</p>
